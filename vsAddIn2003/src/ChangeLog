	* vsprj2makeAddin/connect.cs: Added some error checking and exception
	handling in the event that no copies of the Mono Combined Installer
	are detected at runtime.  Change the labels and descriptions of the 
	"Test in Mono" in favor of "Run on Mono" as suggested by Charlie Poole
	from NUnit.  Added support to use either xsp.exe or xsp2.exe during
	launches of Web Projects on Mono.
	* vsprj2makeAddin/OptionsDlg.resx
	* vsprj2makeAddin/OptionsDlg.cs: Made the entry box for adding the
	LIBS variable value on generated makefiles editable.  Also added a
	radio button selection to determine which xsp server to run.
	* vsprj2makeAddin/MonoLaunchHelper.cs: Added functionality to support
	the xsp server selection.
	* vsprj2makeAddin/RegistryHelper.cs: Change some of the properties
	that are used to store registry values to give more importance to what
	xsp is being run rather than what directory xsp.exe (1.x) stores it.
	Change some of the defaults that are used for creating makefiles to
	favor gtk-sharp-2.0
