-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Description

The Visual Studio Prj2Make# add-in is meant to complement the Mono Combined
Win32 Installer.  This add in should simplify the use of Visual Studio .NET 2003
as a development platform for Mono applications and may ease the deployment of 
the developer's solution to other non-Windows platforms supported by Mono.

As stated above, the vspr2make Add-in is closely linked and dependent of the 
Mono Combined Win32 Installer.

New in this Release:

The addition of a toolbar called MonoBarra. This toolbar contains a button with
the caption "Test in Mono" and a combo box that list all register copies of
the Mono Combined Installer found in the developer's Windows system.

Starting with this version you users will be able to install and use the 
VSPrj2make add-in without needing to first install MonoLaunch.


Requirements:

- Visual Studio .NET 2003

- Mono Combined Win32 Installer (mono-1.1.10-gtksharp-2.4.0-win32-x.x.exe or higher)
