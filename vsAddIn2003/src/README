General Description

The Visual Studio Prj2Make# add-in is meant to complement the Mono Combined
Win32 Installer.  This add in should simplify the use of Visual Studio .NET 2003
as a development platform for Mono applications and may ease the deployment of 
the developer's solution to other non-Windows platforms supported by Mono.

As stated above, the vspr2make Add-in is closely linked and dependent of the 
Mono Combined Win32 Installer.

Requirements:

- Visual Studio .NET 2003

- Mono Combined Win32 Installer (mono-1.0.2-gtksharp-1.0.2-win32-0.7.exe)
